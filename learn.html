                       <h5> For debate to run smoothly and efficiently, the committee's delegates must follow an agreed-upon

procedure. This guide will explain some key concepts and outline a typical committee scenario.<br><br>
In debate, there are three types of consideration:<br><br>
1. Formal Consideration: Your country must be on the speaker's list in order to speak. There is usually a time limit for your speech, which may be adjusted (increased or decreased) as the debate proceeds. <br><br> 

2. Informal Consideration: Delegates simply raise their placards in order to be recognized in ad hoc fashion by the chair. The time limit for discussion may be flexible and at the discretion of the chair. Often, there will be a rapid-fire exchange from one country to another. The chair must moderate this sequence in order to maintain order. Informal discussion is a good technique to brainstorm, problem-solve, gather data and flesh out issues. The chair must ensure that delegates stay on track. <br><br>

3.Caucus: This involves important discussion and arm-twisting in both large and small informal groups. The non-moderated discussion allows nations to actively lobby each other for ideas and support. There is normally a time limit set by the chair. If there are two delegates assigned per team, good strategy would dictate for one to lobby the actual bloc that the delegate is attached to and the other listen in on the strategy being discussed by the rest. Because of the latter strategy, some caucus groups will move to more private areas, outside the committee room. In full day and multi-day debates, informal "caucus" may take place anywhere including lunch or at night on the phone. In this fashion, delegates follow the actual practice employed by real diplomats. Although hard to monitor, a good conference will evaluate the performance of delegates during caucus. (see MUN Tools for more notes on country blocs.)<br><br>

In debate, Points (of Order) largely determine procedure. The following are important types:<br><br>
<ol>
 <li>-Point of Order: Used to correct a mistake in the parliamentary procedure.</li>

 <li>-Point of Parliamentary inquiry: Used to inquire about proper procedure. The chair will rule 

and explain.</li>
 <li>-Point of Information: Used to correct or ask some information.</li>

<li>-Point of Personal Privilege: Used to alleviate a personal discomfort or distraction that impedes 

your participation in debate. (noise, room temperature, volume, movement, etc.)</li></ol><br><br>
When a delegate speaks during formal consideration, s/he may Yield time to another delegate. 

This is a difficult decision because most delegates wish to maximize their own speaking time. 

Sometimes, it is done as a favour to a like-minded country. Some delegates believe that a yield to 

another is a sign of weakness. You will have to determine if it fits within your overall strategy or 

not.<br><br>
When speaking, Yields are as follows:<br><br>

1. Yield to the Chair: The remaining time is left to the chair, and s/he will normally select the 

next speaker. Yielding one's remaining time to the chair prevents anyone from asking you tough 

questions, but it also indicates a weak position. If you want to avoid the hot seat yet curry favour, 

why not yield to a friendly country? <br><br>

2. Yield to Questions: This is the preferred course. The speaker's remaining time is utilized for 

question(s) on the delegate's speech. Only questions on the speech are permitted. This 

demonstrates that the delegate is both secure and prepared to deal with harsh objections. Beware 

that by yielding your remaining time to questions from the floor, you allow adversaries to lead off 

with their own mini-speech preamble before they actually ask their question. 

If you see this happening, immediately interrupt the mini-speech by saying to the chair: "Point of 

order, is there a question?" The chair will normally concur and demand a specific question. 

Another strategy that you might promote in your caucus is to encourage friendly nations to ask 

non-aggressive questions, which will provide you with yet another springboard for extended 

speeches.<br><br>

3.Yield to Another Delegate: As above. The remaining time is given to another delegate.

If a delegate has said some extremely uncomplimentary things about your country, you might 

stand up and say: Right of Reply. Here, a delegate is given the opportunity to defend the nation's 

integrity after being slandered or misrepresented. A right of reply will not be granted in cases of 

personal (versus country) slander. Right of reply is granted at the chair's discretion, and should 

not be abused. If the chair grants such an action, the offending party will be asked if they wish to 

apologize. Slandering your fellow delegates does not impress either them or the chair.<br><br>

Resolutions: This is what the committee is aiming at, a particular recommended course of action 

that will adequately address some specific issue. The proposed resolution forms the basis of 

debate. 
<br><br>
Committees should not try to pass a resolution no matter what. The resolution must be viable. 

Because there are multiple interests and countries, this becomes a difficult process. A resolution 

can be the product of a productive council. It outlines the recommendations suggested by the 

committee. Often, a resolution, in order to pass, will be changed or amended a great deal such 

that the majority can live with it. If you are provided with a ready-made resolution for debate at 

your conference, be aware that there will be many weaknesses deliberately built into it to 

encourage this process of amendment.

Voting: In the Security Council, there are five veto powers. They are the United States, United 

Kingdom, France, Russian Federation, and China. These nations may arbitrarily vote 'no' to a 

resolution, and it is automatically defeated. In all other bodies, there are no veto powers, and you 

will operate on a simple majority. If a permanent member country might veto your resolution, 

your strategy might be to try and persuade that country to abstain in the vote. Otherwise, in the 

other committees, everyone has one vote and is therefore, a potential ally for a simple majority. 

There is no advantage in other committees to being a permanent member. In fact, they are often 

greatly outnumbered by other blocs.</h5>

<br><br>
<h4>Committee Procedure: A Typical Flow Chart</h4><br><br>
<h5>For the novice to get a better idea of how things actually happen in committee, the following is

the sort of procedural dynamic that will typically occur:<br><br> 

1) Motion to open debate. Some chairs will simply declare debate open. If this is the case, there is 

no need to utilize this motion.
<br><br>
2) Motion to set agenda. The topics are usually set ahead of time. If there are multiple topics, a 

speaker for and a speaker for and against are required. A vote is taken, and the majority rules.
<br><br>
3) Motion to open the speaker's list. All nations wishing to be on the speaker's list raise their 

placards or write a note to the chair.<br><br>

4) Motion to set a time limit on speeches. Used in formal consideration only.

At this point procedure can move in many directions. For example, after a few speakers, the 

following may occur:<br><br>

5) Remain in formal consideration (on speaker's list)<br><br>

OR<br>

6) Motion to move into informal consideration. If the latter, after much discussion, there are many 

ideas, therefore -<br><br>

7) If in informal consideration, motion to move back into formal consideration.<br><br>

8) You might motion for a caucus (usually 5 -10 minutes). The purpose would be to further 

develop the ideas into a working paper, and to obtain sponsors in support of these ideas. A 

working paper is the beginning of a resolution. There might be several working papers being 

developed by different groups at the same time. Your task is to bring together those that are 

similar into a larger more powerful bloc that will enjoy greater chance at success. (votes)
<br><br>
9) After the caucus, the council is back in formal consideration. Someone may motion to move 

into informal consideration, or you will remain in formal consideration. (Speaker's list)
<br><br>
10) After collaboration, the working paper needs to be presented to the chair with the sponsoring 

countries listed. Often, you will be given a minimum number of sponsors to obtain before the 

chair will look at your working paper.
<br><br>
11) If the chair deems your working paper to be in order, indicate that your nation wishes to 

introduce it as a resolution before the council.<br><br>

12) Once the chair has approved the working paper (proper format, spelling and grammar), the 

chair will allow for it to be introduced.<br><br>

13) In order to introduce a working paper, the council must be in formal consideration. The 

speaker's list will be utilized.<br><br>

14) The nation that led the writing of the working paper will read it to the council. The time limit 

is suspended for the duration of the reading.<br><br>

15) The chair acknowledges that the working paper is now a resolution. Debate continues over 

the resolution until it is ready to be finally voted upon. When the resolution has been amended, 

and is meets the satisfaction of the council, <br><br>

16) Motion to enter voting procedure. A speaker for and a speaker against are required at this 

time. Simple majority rules. Another way to end debate and force a vote is to move that the 

speaker's list be closed, which effectively stops debate by preventing additional countries to 

speak. The chair will not normally allow this if considered premature and much too early in the 

debate.
<br><br>
At this time, there are several motions that could be made.
<br><br>
a) Motion to divide question. This motion allows the council to separate the operative clauses into 

sections. For example, if a resolution were composed of seven clauses, each recommending some 

specific course of action, each section would then be voted on separately. This might be a last 

ditch effort by some nations to vote down one particular clause (or more) that they cannot live 

with. <br>

OR<br>

b) Roll call vote. Each nation is called upon in alphabetical order. Each nation may say yes, no, 

abstain or pass. If a pass is taken, the chair returns to that delegate. At this point, the delegate may 

say yes or no. Abstentions are no longer permitted.<br><br>

If the resolution is passed, a new topic is selected. If the resolution is not passed, the resolution 

fails and does not exist. The topic goes back into debate. Try not to rush through your topic 

merely to pass a resolution. Often, because of the nature of the topic and a complete lack of 

consensus, a resolution simply cannot be passed. Students must accurately represent the interests 

of their foreign country. You are no longer good-natured Canadians. You might be imperialistic, 

socialist, rich or poor. You might be one of many world faiths including those that you don't 

necessarily agree with. Your country might treat women as equals to men or keep them servile. 

You might sanction terrorism or look the other way at it. The key is that you must execute an 

accurate portrayal. In multi-day conferences, one topic might be discussed for many hours and 

several days. Keep in mind that some of these U.N. issues have been argued for years, not mere 

days. It's up to you to be creative yet not sacrifice your country's interests. You will be evaluated 

on how well you can perform this difficult task.

a position paper. This is a brief overview, which clearly outlines the delegate's strategy vis-a-vis 

the committee issues and the country that is being represented. It indicates to both conference 

organizers and faculty advisors whether or not the student is on track. It is a valuable early 

warning sign if something is amiss. More importantly, whether the position paper is demanded or 

not, its use will serve as an important organizer from which the delegate may maintain consistent 

direction.<br><br>

Long essay type position papers in which the student rewrites the history of the nation are 

counter-productive. A simple organizer that is succinct is needed. After all, it is basically 

employed as a road map.</h5></div></div>
<br>
<div align="center">
<h3> <b>Format of a Position Paper</b></h3><div>
<div align="left">
<h5> A positon papers majorly consists of four major componenets, Topic Background, Past UN Actions, National Policy and the last  and the most important being Proposed solutions.</h5>

<h3><b>1)Topic Background <b></h3><h5><div align="justify">
 
 <h4><b>(i)Most Common Pitfall</b></h4>
   <h5> <strong> It's not an Encyclopedia</strong>—Just because you know facts it doesn't mean it has to be on the paper.</h5><br>
   <h4>(ii)<b>
    Essential Goals</b></h4>

<h5><strong>Project, don’t reflect</strong>- The chair won’t be testing you on what the issue used to be. They want to know where you think it’s going. The goal of this section is not to reflect the past, but project the future. This way,  you can determine the most pressing matters to deal with. That being said, this section should focus on analyzing trends in where the issue appears and identifying obstacles to resolving it.<br><br>
<strong>Break it down</strong>—One of the most important things you can set up in this section is sub-issues. By breaking the issue down into smaller topics, you make the initial problem more manageable and have more targeted goals to frame your solutions.</h5><br>

<h4><b>(iii)Standard Formula</b></h4>

 <h5><ol>
   <li> -Name at least three regions or nations in which the issue is most pronounced.</li>
<li>-Name at least two things these regions or nations have in common that could be the source of the issue.</li>
<li>-Name three relevant historical events that led up to the issue.</li>
<li>-Look at the research you’ve collected so far and note any trends in the conditions under which this issue appears.</li>
<li>-Three sub-issues associated with the topic. (See our article on Framing)</li>
 <li>-For each sub-issue, explain what the deterrent has been in resolving it. Can the UN not enter the nation? Is there too little stability? A lack of education? What factors have made this issue so prominent and difficult to solve?</li>
 <h3><b>2) Past UN Actions <b></h3>

<h4><b>(i)Most Common Pitfalls</b></h4>

 <h5>
 <strong>The Resolution focus:</strong>Many delegates tend to interpret this section heading to mean “Past resolutions”, but in reality, UN resolutions are only the beginning. Often times the most significant information in this section will come from broader action plans or collaborative efforts taken by regional bodies or NGOs. For example, the functions of oversight bodies such as the UN Supervisory Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) are not necessarily connected to a resolution.  <br>
 <br>
 <strong>Listing:</strong>Many delegates place so much focus on compiling a strong list of resolutions that pertain to the topic, that they pass over the analysis part, which is the real purpose of this section.</h5>
 <h4><b>(ii)Essential Goals</b></h4><h5>
 <strong>Analyze Solutions:</strong>Don’t let this section turn into a list of resolutions. Writing about past UN actions isn’t as much about knowing what has been done as providing analysis of why certain actions were taken. Instead of providing a vast quantity of actions, choose a few significant resolutions or action plans and dig into the reasons these plans may have succeeded or failed. This will be the precedent by which you will frame your own solutions to the issue.</h5>
 <h5><strong>Explore failures as well as successes: </strong>Many position papers place the focus of this section on what has been done about the issue. While it is important to understand what plans are already in place, it is equally beneficial to understand what ideas have failed and why. In the case of resolutions, a failed resolution is just as important as a passed one. In the case of the violence in Syria, a UNSC directive supported by the majority of the committee was double vetoed by China and Russia. This is a fairly forceful action that should be taken into account when you consider your own solutions.

<h4><b>(iii)Standard Formula</b></h4>
<h5>
<ul>
<li>Two unique, significant action plans implemented by the UN or other international bodies. (UN-REDD, UNSMIS)</li>
<li>-For every one of the above, answer the following:</li>
<li>-What were the goals of the plan, and were they accomplished?</li>
<li>-Is the plan still in effect?</li>
<li>-What elements may have contributed to the plan’s success/failure?</li>
<li>-What elements of this plan can be adapted to fit the issue at hand?</li>
<li>-Two to three resolutions that have been passed or failed that attempted to deal with the issue</li>
<li>-For each of the above, answer the above questions</li>
<li>-If the resolution failed, specify why. Was it vetoed? What parties voted it down and why might they have done so?</li>
</ul></h5>
<h3><b>3) National Policy <b></h3>
<h4><b>(i)Most Common Pitfalls</b></h4><h5>
<strong>The neutral Nation:</strong>Some nations simply don’t have as strong a policy as others. It’s easy to find public records of South Korea being opposed to North Korean nuclear programs, but it may be more difficult to find exact quotes from government officials or public records of less polarized nations on less controversial issues. In those instances, some extrapolation may be necessary.</h5>
<h4><b>(ii)Essential Goals</b> </h4><h5>
<strong>Explore both the internal and external: </strong>Don’t limit yourself to actions your nation has taken on the international stage. Take some time to explore your nation’s official websites and public records to find out what has been done within your own national borders. Internal legislature and action plans are an excellent source of ideas for dealing with the issue, and are a surefire way to find out how your nation feels about the issue, and because they are implemented by a single nation, they will often be much more strong and action-oriented than international plans.</h5>
<h5><strong>Extrapolate: </strong>Look at factors other than what your nation has done overtly, such as its core values (national sovereignty, humanitarian relief, etc.) and any regional, religious, or political bodies it belongs to (OPEC, NATO, AL). Use this information to determine more about your nation’s policy than is immediately evident by their voting records. Remember: every nation has a policy, even if it isn’t expressed as strongly as those of other nations.</h5>
<br>
<h4><b>(iii)Standard Formula</b></h4>
<h5>
<ul>
<li>-Two internal policies or pieces of legislature your nation has implemented that are relevant to the issue at hand.</li>
<li>-Two programs your nation has supported or been involved in at the international level.</li>
<li>-Two resolutions your nation has voted for or against</li>
<li>-Identify at least two trends among the things your nation has or has not supported.</li>
<li>-An objective analysis of what you feel are the most important goals of your nation. Do you believe in defending national sovereignty? In addressing humanitarian issues above political ones? What is your nation’s agenda?</li>
</ul>
</h5>
<h3><b>4) Proposed Solutions<b></h3>
<h5>
This is where your solution-focused position paper starts to do the work for you. Looking into your background research, you already know where to target your actions, three smaller issues to focus in on, and the preventable events that led up to this being an issue. From your Past UN Action, you know what types of plans have succeeded and failed in the past, and have even drawn conclusions as to what causes them to do so. You also know which ones are still in effect. All you have to decide which ones you want to amend, expand, and discontinue. The beautiful thing about solutions found in this way is that because they already exist, the United Nations does not have to spend valuable time and money setting up an entirely new institution to manage a complex plan. Looking into your nation’s policy, you also know what measured have proven effective or ineffective at the national level, so you know what sorts of actions the UN can encourage other nations to take, and even aid them in doing so. The final part of your proposed solutions is making sure that you have addressed all three of your sub-issues.</h5>

<h3><b><div align="center"> Sample Position Paper</div><b></h3>

<h5>
<strong>Committee:</strong> United Nations Security Council<br>
<strong>Topic:</strong> Territorial Disputes in South China Sea<br>
<strong>Country:</strong> People’s Republic of China<br>
<strong>Name of Delegate:</strong> Yathannsh Kulshrestha<br>
<br>
The factors responsible for mounting tensions in the South China Sea issue include the territorial
disputes on islands, reefs and overlapping claims on maritime rights and interests in waters of the
South China Sea, which are caused by the illegal inhabitation of some islands and reefs of China's
Nansha & Spratly Islands by some coastal countries. Formed in the long historic course, China's
sovereignty and relevant rights in the South China Sea have solid historic and legal basis, and have
been upheld by successive Chinese governments. People’s Republic of China inalienable
sovereignty within the nine-dotted line, which includes the Spratly islands, the Paracel islands, the
scarborough shoal and their adjacent waters, is indisputable. However, surrounding nations of the
South China Sea have failed to respect the territorial sovereignty of China, which have stirred up
minor conflict and in turn has imposed a threat to economic partnership among nations.<br><br>

China's basic guidelines for neighbouring diplomacy is to build good-neighborly relations and
bringing harmony, security and prosperity to neighbouring countries, and concentrate on the
concept of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness. China has maintained strategic and
cooperative relationship for peace and development with the relevant states parties of the current
situation at the South China Sea. High-level exchanges have been frequent and economic
cooperation has been fruitful. Yet, states parties involved have constantly acted provocatively
towards China’s economic exclusive zones (EEZ), maritime and land territories, which have
resulted in escalating tension and armed clashes. The Sino-Vietnamese War, Mischief Reef
Incident and the 1998 Johnson South Reef Skirmish all proved costly to the regional stability and
the long-term partnership among the nations in the late-20th century. The consequences of the past
incidents, however, have not ended their aggressive incursion into China’s own EEZ, maritime and
land territories. Earlier this year, Vietnam began an oil exploratory drilling with a foreign energy
company within the economic exclusive zone of China. Tensions at the South China Sea escalate
further with the involvement of the United States. China has routinely intercepted reconnaissance
activities within its EEZ undertaken by the United States. Without the consent and notice of the
administration, these activities not only infringe upon the China’s domestic law and international
law but also undermine the stability of the region.<br><br>

China strictly abides by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In accordance with
the aforementioned document, China has been continuously carrying out its work to safeguard the
territorial integrity in respond to deliberate provocations, recalling President Xi Jinping’s remark,
“We are strongly committed to safeguarding the country's sovereignty and security, and defending
our territorial integrity.” In 2013, China established the State Oceanic Administration (SOA), which
exercises China’s jurisdiction over the marine area. Besides defending our territorial waters and
EEZ, the SOA is also for the environmental protection of our waters. With respect to oil drilling,
since China has indisputable sovereignty over the Spratly islands Paracel islands and their adjacent
waters, any planned activities by the Xi’s administration fall completely within the Chinese internal
affairs, China therefore continues its operation at the South China Sea.<br>
<br>
China firmly believes that mutually beneficial cooperation could be reached with our partners of
Southeast Asia. For such a purpose, China sponsors a two-phased plan for strengthening peace and
stability at the South China Sea. During the first phase, China supports bilateral pact of mutual
cooperation between relevant states parties. After years of cooperation in maritime development,
the plan will then enter the second phase – a multilateral settlement on disarmament which will
ultimately bring greater stability to the region. China believes confidence building among nations is
critical in resolution towards the current situation. Thus, we will continually work towards a
peaceful coexistence in coordination with relevant parties. China stands ready to actively pursue a
harmonious maritime order at the South China Sea.

It is the best opportunity for you to explain your country policy and the key sub-issues you would like the committee to focus on. Opening Speeches is a main way for countries to determine who they want to work with, so it’s important to prepare a speech that conveys this.

->Then begin by <b>providing a brief history on the issue as it relates to your country</b>, and <b>how the issue is currently affecting your country.</b><br>
<b>Provide your country's position on the issue.</b> Include an explanation for your country’s stance, such as economic or security concerns or political or religious ideology.<br><br>
You should discuss some of the <b>past actions taken by the UN</b>, member states and NGOs to address the issue.<br><br>
Present <b>ideas for a resolution</b>, stressing your country’s objectives for the resolution.<br>
You may want to add information that was not in your position paper, such as:<br>

<h4><b>Committee:</b> UNSC<br>
    <b>Country:</b>China<br>
    <b>Agenda:</b> Territorial Disputes in South China Sea<br>

<h4>Thank you, chair.

The core of the South China Sea issue rests with the territorial disputes
on islands, reefs, and overlapping claims on maritime rights in waters
of the South China Sea, which are caused by the illegal occupation of
some islands and reels of China's Paracel Islands by some coastal
countries. Formed in the long historic course, China's sovereignty and
relevant rights in the South China Sea have solid historic and legal
basis, and have been upheld by successive Chinese govemments.<br><br><br>

The basic guidelines for Chinas neighbouring diplomacy, is to bring
security a concentrate on the concept of amity, mutual beneﬁt and
inclusiveness. As a coastal country of the South China Sea, China has
always been a staunch force for maintaining peace, stability and
promoting cooperation and development China is the last country
that hopes to see any turbulence in South China Sea.<br><br>

China firrnly believes that mutually beneficial cooperation could be
reached with our partners of Southeast Asia. For such a purpose, China
sponsors a two-phased plan for strengthening peace and stability at
the South China Sea.<br><br>

During the first phase, China supports bilateral pact of mutual
cooperation between relevant states parties. And the second
phase would be - a multilateral settlement on disarmament which
will ultimately bring greater stability to the region and help build
coniidence among nations, which is critically important . China stands
ready to actively pursue a harmonious maritime order at the South
China Sea.<br><br>

The delegation of China welcomes opinion and insights ol all the
delegates present here and looks forward to work with you in Moderated
and Unmoderated Caucasuses. Thank you<br>

    A resolution can be divided

 <h5>
 Forming up this part of the resolution may vary
from MUN to MUN which is why it should be 
discussed with the Executive Board before 
commencing upon writing a resolution for the 
committee. However, a typical heading would 
include (in chronological order):<br><br>

  -Resolution Name<br>

  -Authors/Sponsors/Submitted by: <br>

  -Signatories:<br></h5>
  <h4> <b>Example</b></h4>
  <hr>
  <h5>
    <div align="right">Resolution 1.1</div><br>

    <strong>Signatories:</strong>USA, Japan, Nigeria,Belgium
<hr>
 <h4> <b><div align="center">Preambulatory Clauses</div></b></h4>

<h4> <b>Purpose</b></h4>

<h5>Usually referred to as preambles or 
preams (that?s MUN slang). These are
clauses that should explain the problem and
issue that is being addressed. They should 
be informative; however, they should not 
propose any action.</h5>

<h4> <b>Format</b></h4>
<h5>
   - Begin with passive verb (underlined) <br>

 -Followed by a comma<br>

                            <h3>Making Speeches</h3>
                            <p>Apart from research, Model UN conferences are a test to your speaking skills. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div align="justify">
       <h4> Making spontaneous speeches is one major aspect of MUNs. You will be required to make formal speeches mainly at two occasions. First during your opening statements(GSLs) and then during formal debating (MODs).Therefore, practicing the right speaking technique will always help you get an upper hand at your committee.
        <br><br>
        You are trying to persuade others! To be successful, you must attend to their feelings as well as 

their logic. To convince others that you have a solution to a specific problem or a valid point, you 

first, must get their attention. Then, using appropriate oral and body language, you must maintain 

their attention and make them want to act upon your instructions. Don’t forget: what you say and 

how you say it are equally important. In fact, many think the latter is actually far more important! 

Once you sit down, there will be many other speakers. How will you be remembered?  


               
<div align="center"><h3> <b>Speaking Techniques<b></h3></div>
<h3><b>Getting Attention</b></h3><h4>
1) Humour is a dangerous technique in debate, particularly when discussing serious topics. <br><br>

2) The machine-gun: use rapid-fire examples, piling up the evidence.<br><br>

3) Begin with a quotation: a short quotation, proverb, saying, poem, etc. will often sum up the 

situation. If you can find it from someone in your represented country, the more appropriate it 

will be. If you are clever, you can use this technique repeatedly.<br><br>

4) Begin with a startling statement. Make it lead directly to the problem. If you do not have a 

specific situation to refer to, begin with: "imagine that…."<br><br>

5)Begin with a rhetorical question, something that the audience knows the answer to. Beware of 

this approach. It can be a weak start.<br>
<br>
6)Begin with a specific example of the problem. Zero in on one concrete aspect and then build 

from there. In small-scale debates, you will have many more opportunities to speak. In large 

debates, however, you might not enjoy the same luxury. <br><br>

7)Be aware of any time limits on your speech, and give yourself time for a strong finish before 

the chair cuts you off.<br><br>
</h4>
<h3><b>Maintain Attention</b></h3><h4>

1)Demonstrate the extent of the problem. Use examples, statistics, and expert opinion.<br><br>

2)Demonstrate the effects of the problem. How does it affect the people? Use examples and facts.<br><br>

3)Demonstrate the causes of the problem. This might be difficult.<br><br>

4)Demonstrate how the problem affects the others. Be vivid.<br><br>

5)Present your solution or better, a joint solution from several delegates. Be clear about time, 

costs, people and other resources required. Try to show where similar solutions have worked.<br><br>

6)Try to use visual images as opposed to dry expressions. Paint them a picture.<br>

Demonstrate how your solution will: <br>


reduce or eliminate the cause(s) of the problem <br>


reduce or eliminate the symptoms<br>


help people<br>


result in advantages <br>


reduce costs; increase efficiency<br><br>


7) Paint the opposite terrible scenario if your plan is not adopted.<br><br>


8) Appeal for action and their motives of: fair play, desire to save, be helpful, pride, intelligence, 

community.<br><br>

At the end of your speech, return to the topic sentence and revise it. Ask for their assistance by 

challenging them to do something, summarizing the important points, and indicating your own 

intention to do something. Close with a strong appeal for action.

                        </div>
                        <div align="left">
                        
                     
<ul>
  <li><strong>Abstention</strong>:  abstaining from a vote means to withdraw from voting on a resolution instead of  giving a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer. </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Amendments</strong>:  are made to resolutions.  Friendly  amendments require the support of the sponsors in order for changes to be  made.  Unfriendly amendments can be  initiated by anyone in the committee but require supporters and a majority  vote.</li>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>BATNA  (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement)</strong>: what if your  preferred solution cannot be accomplished or agreed upon by the committee?  Each delegate should have a BATNA on each  issue that will be debated in order to promote compromise and co:operation.</li>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bloc</strong>: a  group of countries that form a logical combination because of geographical,  economic, or cultural considerations (eg. G8, African bloc, Arab League).</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Caucus</strong>: a  forum where the rules of debate are suspended and delegates are able to gather  in groups and freely discuss and write with one another (for others a bathroom  or socializing break).  Usually some of a  committee&rsquo;s most productive work is accomplished during caucuses.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Comments</strong>: if  a delegate doesn&rsquo;t yield his/her time during a speech in formal debate, the  chair may recognize two delegates to make comments specifically on that speech.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dividing  the Question</strong>: once in voting procedure, a motion to divide the  question means splitting up operative clauses to be voted on separately (eg.  Vote on Clauses 1 and 3 together, but the rest individually).  This is useful if you agree with one part of  a resolution but not the whole thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>EU  (European Union)</strong>: an economic and political union created under  the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, it comprises most of Western Europe and Germany,  and is poised for future expansion into Central and Eastern Europe.  Most customs regulations in Europe have now  been abolished and a single currency is now in place, the Euro.  As a political unit it has formidable power  vis:à:vis the United States.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Foreign  Aid</strong>: money given by one country to another for  humanitarian or developmental purposes.   It plays a key role in shaping foreign policy.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Foreign  Policy</strong>: the attitudes and interests of a state towards  external issues.  Foreign policy can be  influenced by a variety of factors, i.e. Military strength, trading partners,  history, domestic government.</li>
 
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Formal  Debate</strong>: the committee follows a speaker&rsquo;s list, and each  speaker is given a strict time limit within which to make their point.  They must also formally yield the floor to  questions, the chair, or another delegate.   Rules regarding motions, voting and &ldquo;right of reply&rdquo; are enforceable  only in formal consideration, although at COWAC conferences informal debate is  preferred for the most part.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>G8  (Group of Eight)</strong>: a body comprised of eight of the world&rsquo;s most  powerful nations: Canada, the U.S., U.K., France, Italy, Japan, Germany, and  Russia.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Informal  Debate</strong>: can be entered into by a simple motion and majority  vote.  The chair recognizes delegates  wishing to speak, but there are no yields, time limits or opportunities to  directly question one another.  However,  it offers the chance to proceed quicker through various issues that arise  during debate.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ICJ  (International Court of Justice)</strong>: the ICJ is a body designed  to resolve legal and territorial disputes between states.</li>
 
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lobbying</strong>:  refers to informal caucusing between a small group of delegates, usually  outside the committee room while debate is still in progress.  One may wish to lobby another delegate for  support on a resolution or policy option, but use with caution.  A delegation of two or more can afford to  spare someone outside the room much more easily than a solo debater.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Motions</strong>:  most motions can only be made in formal debate.   In fact, the only motion permitted in informal debate is to move to  formal debate.  Motions must be made to  open, close, postpone, or adjourn debate, to set the agenda, table the topic,  enact right of reply, an caucus.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>NATO  (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)</strong>: security organization  created in 1949 by Western powers to provide a collective force against the  Soviet Union.  In the post:Cold War era  it has taken on new responsibilities in peacekeeping and enforcement of  international law (Bosnia, Kosovo).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>NGO&rsquo;s  (Non:governmental Corporations)</strong>: are organizations or  associations that are not associated with a specific country or international  political organization.  Their aims can  be broad (World Vision International, Amnesty International, Greenpeace) or quite  specific (Doctors Without Borders) in their activities and goals.  The United Nations has a history of working  closely with NGO&rsquo;s on issues, especially relating to humanitarian projects. </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Non:Members</strong>:  delegates who sit in a committee and are allowed to speak but don&rsquo;t have voting  privileges.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>OAS  (Organization of American States)</strong>: an international political  organization comprised of North and South American states.</li>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Operative  Clauses</strong>: are written in resolutions following the  preamble.  These numbered clauses set out  actual solutions and initiatives for the committee to undertake.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Placard</strong>: is  your key prop at all times.  Just be sure  not to replace it with your own creation, or to wave it hysterically while  someone else is speaking.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Points</strong>:  can be raised in formal or informal debate. There are two points that can interrupt a speech, Point of Personal Privilege or Point of Order. In total their are 5 points:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>-Personal  Privilege</strong>: if there&rsquo;s too much noise, heat/cold, etc…</li>


  <li><strong>-Order</strong>:  this point can be raised if a rule has been violated.</li>


  <li><strong>-Parliamentary  Inquiry</strong>: a question on the rules and procedure of debate.</li>


  <li><strong>-Information</strong>:  general questions to the chair.   </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <li><strong>Position  Paper</strong>: a written statement by a delegate on a particular  agenda topic, outlining one&rsquo;s foreign policy, proposed solutions and  alternatives.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><strong>Perambulatory  Clauses</strong>: these clauses go at the beginning of a resolution,  and act to introduce the issue (concerns, previous UN actions, etc..).  They are not numbered.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rhetoric</strong>:  using language designed to persuade that is often extravagant and  laboured.  In MUN debating chairs often  penalize delegates who rely on rhetoric instead of making substantive speeches.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Right  of Reply</strong>: This can only be asked for in formal debate, if a  delegate feels another debater has insulted and/or slandered their country or  them personally. It is easily the most over:attempted and misused motion in MUN  debating.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Roll  Call</strong>: a motion made in voting procedure to individually  call out each country&rsquo;s name for their vote.   A delegate can vote for, vote against, abstain, or pass.  A country that passes will be asked again at  the end of the list, but cannot abstain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Security  Council</strong>: the most powerful body within the UN, it is  comprised of fifteen members, five of whom are permanent (see Veto  Powers).  It is responsible for the UN&rsquo;s  peace and security policy, dealing with conflict through peacekeeping,  sanctions and other measures.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Speaker&rsquo;s  List</strong>: In formal debate the chair follows the speaker&rsquo;s  list to recognize delegates.  Your  country&rsquo;s name can&rsquo;t be on it more than once at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sponsor/Co:sponsor</strong>:  Working papers and resolutions require sponsors (the main authors) and in some  cases co:sponsors.  Being a co:sponsor  does not necessarily mean being in support of the ideas presented, you may just  want to see them debated in front of the rest of the committee.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>UN  (United Nations)</strong>: a good idea to learn this one.  The international organization that was  created in 1945 from the legacy of World War Two to promote and protect  international peace and security, co:operation, and human rights worldwide.  It&rsquo;s legitimacy comes from the UN Charter,  with its major bodies including the Security Council, the General Assembly, and  the various committees that comprise the Economic and Social Council.  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Veto  Powers</strong>: the five permanent members of the Security Council  (U.S., U.K., France, Russia and China) have the right to single:handedly veto a  resolution by voting no.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Working  Paper</strong>: sometimes referred to as an &ldquo;idea paper&rdquo; also,  although working paper is the preferred formal term.  It is drawn up in the form of a resolution,  but its status as a &ldquo;working paper&rdquo; allows for easily made amendments that do  not require the support of the entire committee, only the sponsors  themselves.  Working papers are one step  below being a resolution, and many are often combined into one.  Their overall purpose is to set out specific  solutions or policy stances on an issue that can be debated within the  committee.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Yield</strong>: In  formal debate the delegate must yield his/her time a the beginning of their  speech in one of three ways:</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>To the chair: once the speech is over the chair  takes the floor and moves on with the speaker&rsquo;s list.</li>

  <li>To questions: delegates can ask questions to  the speaker for his/her remaining time.   (A recommended practice)</li>



  <li>To another delegate: another speaker uses up  the remaining time to give a speech, but cannot yield themselves.</li>
</ol>

                    <p><strong>Conference</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Awards Policy. </strong>If      you’re trying to win an award, then you should know what the conference      values and what your chair is looking for.</p>
<p><strong>2. Rules of      Procedure. </strong>Rules tell you how committee is going operate, and what you can      and cannot do. They differ for every conference &#8212; not just what the rules      are, but how they are applied.</p>
<p><strong>Committee</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Your committee’s      actual UN website. </strong>The goal of a committee is to pass a resolution, which      depends on what a committee can and cannot do. You want to understand your      committee’s mandate (why it was created), powers (what it can do), organization      (how it fits into the UN and the larger international community), and      membership (who’s in it).</p>
<p><strong>4. UN Charter. </strong>If      you are in a GA, ECOSOC, or Security Council committee, then the source of      your committee’s power is the UN Charter. If you are in a regional      organization like NATO or OAS, then you are still affected by the Charter,      particularly Chapter VII on international security and Chapter VIII on      regional arrangements.</p>

You want      to know your country’s location, neighbors, population size, type of      government, type of economy, trade partners, and the international      organizations it’s a part of. Not knowing this information as your      country’s representative can be potentially embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>6. Wikipedia. </strong>Information      on your country’s history and its recent controversies. There should be      articles on your topic, too. Wikipedia might not be edited as rigorously      as a print publication, but you are not writing a paper – you’re attending      a Model UN conference. Just take note of any potential issues that are      listed at the topic of Wikipedia pages, e.g. “This article needs      additional citations for verification.”</p>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. Background Guide.</strong> Either you, another delegate, or your chair will inevitably refer to      something written in the committee’s background guide during a conference.      Also, what your chair has written about is what he’ll focus on in      committee. Use that knowledge to craft speeches and operative clauses that      grab the chair’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>8. News Articles.</strong> You      want to know the latest news on your topics, as well as your own country.      The simplest way to do this is to run searches on Yahoo! News and Google      News, and print out the headlines. BBC Online also features easy-to-use      timelines and profiles on your issues and country. Large publications like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal also have in-depth coverage on their websites.</p>
<p><strong>9. Resolutions,      Treaties, and Conventions.</strong> Before you can do anything on the topic, you      need to know what’s already been done. You can find past resolutions      through the <a href="http://www.un.org/documents/resga.htm">UN documentation center</a>, although it can be difficult to      navigate. Once you’ve found the latest resolution, the perambulatory      clauses should direct you to other resolutions. Also, the most relevant piece      of international law on your topic might not be a past resolution, but      instead a treaty or convention.</p>
<p><strong>Policies</strong></p>
<p><strong>10. Speeches and      Press Releases.</strong> These are the ways that policy-makers set policy. Be sure to      use speeches and press releases from people in the executive branch of your country’s current government (President, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister / Secretary of State, Ambassadors). Legislators and judges may say something different, but as a      representative of your country, you work for the Head of State / Head of      Government. Start with the website for your country&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs /      Department of State.</p>
<p><strong>11. Voting Record.</strong> Actions speak louder than words.      If your country’s leaders have not clearly articulated a policy on your      topic, then you can infer it from how your country has voted on past resolutions, treaties, and conventions (or whether they were even present). Note that recent speeches may indicate a change in      policy away from however your country has voted in the past, especially if      your government has changed administrations. Nonetheless, you still want      to know how your country’s past actions on the topic, for your own      knowledge, and in case anyone asks.</p>
<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>
<p><strong>12. Op-Ed and Blog Articles. </strong>These writers are coming from a personal or journalistic perspective, but they      can still give you ideas that you can propose in committee and use in resolutions. You can start with large publications like the New York Times or Wall Street Journal, but don&#8217;t forget about blogs, too. Just be aware of their biases, and make sure their ideas conform      to your country’s policies.</p>
<p><strong>13. Think Tanks.</strong> Organizations like <a href="http://www.rand.org/">RAND</a> are paid to come up with solutions to the topics you discuss in Model UN. Think tank publications have more depth and evidence than an opinion article, but they&#8217;re typically not as dense as an academic paper. They might also be pushing a certain agenda, so be aware of      that. Otherwise, they are a great starting point for proposing      potential solutions.</p>
<p><strong>14. Academic Papers.</strong> These are tough reads and the information is way too dense for Model UN. But      they are probably the most insightful and rigorously edited sources you will      find online. You can use Google Scholar to find papers. Don’t spent time      trying to process a paper the way you would do for a class. Read the      abstract and skim the paper for ideas that you can use in committee.</p>
<p><strong>15. Your Ideas.</strong> Include in your binder your position      papers, working papers, notes, thoughts, as well as blank lined paper – Don’t      rely on a conference to bring enough paper for draft resolutions and note      passing. You can do all the research you want, and you can be really fast and efficient at it, but none of that matters until you boil down what you&#8217;ve read into ideas that you can explain in your own words.</p>
